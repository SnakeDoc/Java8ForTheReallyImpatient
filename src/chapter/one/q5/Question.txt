Q: Take a file from one of your projects that contains a number of
	`ActionListener`, `Runnable`, or the like. Replace them with lambda
	expressions. How many lines did it save? Was the code easier to read?
	Were you able to use method references?

A: Saved eight lines in the basic example I came up with. Even though saving
	lines is not always the best goal to reach for - clarity being more
	important - in this case the result was an easier to read piece of code.
	I was also able to use a method reference for printing files.
