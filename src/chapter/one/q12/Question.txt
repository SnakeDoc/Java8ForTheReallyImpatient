Q: In the past, you were told that it's bad form to add methods to an interface
	because it would break existing code. Now you are told that it's okay to
	add new methods, provided you also supply a default implementation. How
	safe is that? Describe a scenario where the new `stream` method of the
	`Collection` interface causes legacy code to fail compilation. What about
	binary compatibility? Will legacy code from a `JAR` file still run?
	
A: This is safe so long as legacy code does not also implement a `stream`
	method with different return types, which would cause a signature mismatch.
	
	Binary compatibility with legacy `JAR` files is preserved so long as the
	legacy code is not recompiled with a new jre target level higher than the
	original codebase was supposed to support. Doing so would cause the
	conflict described above.
