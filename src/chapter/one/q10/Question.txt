Q: Go through the methods of the `Collections` class. If you were king for a
	day, into which interface would you place each method? Would it be a
	default method or a static method?
	
A: There are too many methods to enumerate all changes here, however factory
	methods would be best left static but moved to appropriate classes for
	their generated types, such as `List.nCopies()`. This would be more clear
	to the reader that this method produces a `List` type. `Void` return types
	would best be moved into the appropriate collection interface type as
	default methods, so that any concrete implementation of that interface
	would have the default implementations available, such as 
	`myList.shuffle()`, which would also improve readability and clarity of
	the code.
