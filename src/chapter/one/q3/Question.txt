Q: Using the `list(FilenameFilter)` method of the `java.io.File` class, write a
	method that returns all files in a given directory with a given extension.
	Use a lambda expression, not a `FilenameFilter`. Which variables from the
	enclosing scope does it capture?

A: We capture the file extension variable as a Free Variable inside the lambda.
